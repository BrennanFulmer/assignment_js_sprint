/*
1. Build a Roulette game using basic object-oriented programming principles in
JavaScript. The user should start with a bankroll and bet with each "spin" of
the imaginary wheel. They can choose numbers 1-36. After each spin, the result
is displayed and funds are distributed accordingly (payout is 35:1). Gameplay
might look something like:

r = new Roulette( 100 )  // starting bankroll $100
r.spin( 10, 24 )         // bet 10 on 24
// You Win $350, the spin was 24!!!
// You now have $440.
r.spin( 50, 13 )
// You Lose, the spin was 11 :(
// You now have $390
r.bankroll()
// You now have $390
r.buyIn( 1000 )
// You bought in $1000
// You now have $1390

2. Add the ability for users of your Roulette game to bet on "0" (35:1),
"00" (35:1), "Even" (1:1), "Odd" (1:1), "1 to 18" (1:1), "19 to 36" (1:1),
"1st 12" (2:1), "2nd 12" (2:1), or "3rd 12" (2:1).
